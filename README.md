Dear David Jao,

please first sudo apt-get install the latest expect and gnuchess libraries:

the only file you need is chessfull.sh

*** Please use the command: ***

chmod 755 chessfull.sh

to call our program in the command line please navigate to containing

directory and enter './chessfull.sh white' or './chessfull.sh black'

without quotes, depending on which colour our program is to play.
